# common-exports
Convert ES Modules (even in dependencies) to CommonJS. Resolves dependency issues and creates both ES and CommonJS module compatibility for packages.

### Goals

Using this tool suite, you can:

* Convert packages in node_modules from es6 Module into cloned CommonJs module (this will be stored in a directory of your choosing)
* Convert your own project from es6 Module into cloned CommonJs module, so you can distribute more compatible code

## Installation

In your project's root directory, run: `npm install --save-dev gulp common-exports`
(or `yarn add --dev gulp common-exports` if you use Yarn).

It is recommended to install gulp with the `-g` flag, so that you can run it with `gulp` instead
of `node_modules/.bin/gulp`.

## Usage

In your `gulpfile.js` add the following:

```js
const convertToCommon = () => {
  const { makeCommon } = require('common-exports')
  const mainFile = 'path to the main file you wish to convert'
  const vendorPath = 'path to the directory where your exported file (and dependencies) should go'
  return makeCommon(mainFile, vendorPath, { rootPath: './' })
}

exports.convertCommon = convertToCommon
```

Make sure to use the correct main file you wish to start conversion at and also the output directory for the conversion.
